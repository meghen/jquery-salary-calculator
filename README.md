# JQuery Salary Calculator App
## Description
Duration: 1 Weekend

Employees were entered into a mock system, their annual salaries all added together and divided to find the total monthly cost the company incurred from paying said employees. If an employee should leave, the company can then delete that employee and the monthly costs would reflect that change.
